    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    
    <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 onion finely chopped</li>
    <li>1 lb. ground beef</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp ground chili powder</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp  ground paprika</li> 
    <li>1/2 tsp ground cumin</li>
    <li>Kosher salt</li>
    <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>8 medium flour tortillas</li>
    <li> 1 1/2 Monterey Jack, shredded</li>
    <li> 1 avocado, sliced</li>
    <li> 2 tbsp chopped cilantro</li>

    
 </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
 <ol>
    <li>In a large pan over medium heat, heat oil. Cook onion until soft, 5 minutes. Add ground beef and spices, breaking up the meat with a wooden spoon, and season with salt and pepper. Stir occasionally and cook until the meat cooked through and no longer pink, about 8 minutes. Remove pan from heat and drain excess fat. Season mixture with salt and pepper to taste. Clean pan and return over medium heat.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, assembly quesadillas: Divide cheese between 4 tortillas. Top with beef mixture, avocado, and cilantro then top each tortilla with a second tortilla.</li>
    <li>Working one at a time, transfer quesadillas to hot pan and cook until golden-brown underneath, about 3 minutes. When ready to flip, cover the pan with a large plate. Invert pan to transfer the quesadilla onto the plate, then slide the quesadilla back onto the pan (golden side up). Cook until golden-brown on other side.</li>
    <l1>Slice into wedges before serving. </l1>
